## Introduction

The aim of this study is to quantify how "free" a basketball player is and how this influences his 3-points shot performance.

## Data

The dataset we use is derived from ***Stats*** company data and *SportsVU* technology. These are the 632 men's basketball games in the NBA between the 2013-2014 and 2016-2017 seasons. For each match we have the movement data for the ball and players taken 25 times per second and stored in the form _JavaScript Object Notation_ (JSON). The following figure shows the general structure of the data:
